Original Exercise Questions: 

1. Write a Python program to find those numbers which are both divisible by 7 and 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included).

2. Write a Python program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6. Hint: Use 'continue' statement.  Expected Output : 0 1 2 4 5

3. Write a Python program which iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
Sample Output : 
Fizzbuzz
1
2
Fizz
4 
Buzz

4. Write a Python program to find numbers between 100 and 400 (both included) where each digit of a number is an even number. The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence.

5. Write a program that asks a user for a number and then tests whether it is prime or not and prints out “The number is prime” or “The number is not prime”.

6. Write a Python function to find the Max of three numbers, then ask the user for three numbers and test it.

7. Write a Python program to guess a number between 1 to 9.
Note : User is prompted to enter a guess. If the user guesses wrong then the prompt appears again until the guess is correct, on successful guess, user will get a "Well guessed!" message, and the program will exit.

8. Write a python function to reverse a string, then ask the users for a string to test it.

9. Write a Python function that accepts a string and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters. (Hint you can use isupper and islower to test for the case of the letters).

10. Create a program that calculates cooking times for meat based on the following criteria:
Present the user with a menu where they type 1 for Beef (well done), 2 for Chicken, 3 for Lamb and 4 for Pork and ask them for the weight of the piece of meat in kg
Calculate the cooking time for Beef using this formula 50 minutes per kg plus 20 minutes
Calculate the cooking time for Chicken using this formula 45 minutes per Kg plus 20 minutes
Calculate the cooking time for Lamb using this formula 60 minutes per kg plus 30 minutes
Calculate the cooking time for Pork using this formula 70 minutes per kg plus 35 minutes
Print out “The cooking time for a piece of <meat name> that weighs <weight> is <time> minutes”

11. Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game. (Hint: Ask for player plays (using input), compare them, print out a message of congratulations to the winner, and ask if the players want to start a new game.
Remember the rules:
Rock beats scissors
Scissors beats paper
Paper beats rock
